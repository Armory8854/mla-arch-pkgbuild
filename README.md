# Multilogin For Arch

## Introduction
https://multilogin.com/
NOTE: I (the maintainer of this repo) am in no way affiliated with Multilogin. This PKGBUILD comes with no warranties or guarantees. Issues with the build itself may be submitted, but anything involving the actual code of the software is out of my grasp. Multilogin is NOT an open source application.

This is a PKGBUILD script for Multilogin, which is a multiple-browser replacement tool. Use of the program requires a multilogin account, and an agreement to their Terms of Service.

To install the package, run the following commands:

```
git clone https://github.com/Armory8854/mla-arch-pkgbuild.git
cd mla-arch-pkgbuild
makepkg -si
```
